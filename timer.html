    "//1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements? 
    setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
    //calls the function every 2 seconds.
    setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
    //calls the function boyah immediately gives error the second time it is called.
    //2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)? 
    var myfunc = function (a, x) {
        return a * x;
    };
    var x = myfunc(2, 3);//6
    
    var y = myfunc; //error
    
    alert(x); //6
    
    alert(y(2, 3)); //6
    //3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”

    //4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
    
    //Unobtrusive Javascript is the basic concept behind unobtrusive JavaScript (also known as "unobtrusive DOM scripting") is to 
    provide a best practice approach to JavaScript programming that maintains usability and accessibility, and degrades gracefully.
     Code maintainability from a programming perspective can also be considered a goal of unobtrusive JavaScript."
    //,Unobtrusive JavaScript can improve the performance of web pages by reducing the size and complexity of their code, and by using 
    techniques such as lazy loading, caching, and asynchronous loading to optimize the delivery of resources. This can help to reduce the
    load time and bandwidth usage of a page, and improve its responsiveness and user experience.
